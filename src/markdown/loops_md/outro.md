## Putting It All Together

Since we have verified that these axioms hold, we conclude that the **fundamental group** $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ is indeed a *group* under the operation of **path concatenation**. This establishes the fundamental group as a well-defined algebraic structure, encapsulating the essential features of loops based at a point in a topological space. This result is a fundamental concept in algebraic topology, linking the geometric idea of loops with algebraic group theory.
