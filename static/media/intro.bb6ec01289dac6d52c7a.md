# The Fundamental Group is a Group

Algebraic topology can be roughly defined as the study of techniques for forming
algebraic images of topological spaces. 
One of the simplest and most important functors
of algebraic topology is the **fundamental group**; which provides a group of a
space from the loops in the space.

In this interactive exploration of the fundamental group, we begin by illustrating key players of the fundamental group and conclude with a proof that, the fundamental group is, indeed, a *group*.

## Loops

A **path** in a space $X$ is defined by the map $f:I \mapsto X$ where $I$ is the unit interval $[0,1]$. A **loop** is path such that we restrict the start and end points to be the same; $f(0)=f(1)$. We denote this as $x_0$, also known as the **basepoint**.
